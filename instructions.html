        <p>Welcome to the Dots & Boxes Game! Here are the detailed instructions on how to play:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Game Setup:</strong><br> - Select the number of rows and columns (between 5 and 30).<br> - Select the number of players (between 2 and 6).<br> - Choose a theme from the available options.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Objective:</strong><br> The objective of the game is to complete the maximum number of boxes. The player who completes the most boxes wins the game.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Gameplay:</strong><br> - Players take turns to draw a line between two adjacent dots.<br> - A player who completes the fourth side of a box gets to claim that box and gets another turn.<br> - The game continues until all the boxes
                are completed.<br> - If a player completes a box, they get another turn immediately.<br> - The game can be played in rounds, and the player with the highest score after a set number of rounds wins the game.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Scoring:</strong><br> - Each completed box is worth one point.<br> - The player with the highest score at the end of the game is the winner.<br> - In case of a tie, the player who completed the last box wins. - Optionally, a tie
                can be broken by the number of consecutive boxes completed.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Strategies:</strong><br> - Try to force your opponent into a position where they have to give you a box.<br> - Plan your moves ahead and avoid creating a situation where your opponent can complete a box unless you can complete
                the fourth side.<br> - Control the board by capturing multiple boxes in one turn by carefully planning your moves.<br> - Take advantage of the extra turn you get after completing a box to create more opportunities for yourself.<br> - Look
                for opportunities to create chains and loops of boxes that can be captured in one turn.<br> - Be mindful of your opponent's potential moves and try to block them from completing boxes whenever possible.
